- create a file called `.env` using `.env.example` as a template
- run `pip install poetry` if you don't have it
- run `poetry install` to fetch dependencies
- run `poetry shell` to use the new environment
- run `python relay.py` to run the relay

I will add a service to run it as a daemon at some point
